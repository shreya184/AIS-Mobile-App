        <b> Tax Relief Act (TRA97) </b>
The Tax Relief Act of 1997 provides for several tax benefits for parents and students. Previously, the Act allowed borrowers to deduct student loan interest paid within the first 60 months of repayment. For tax year 2002 any and all interest paid on the loan from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2002, is tax deductible. Payments made beginning January 1, 1998 can be deducted on 1998 tax returns filed in 1999. The deduction is limited to $1,000 in 1998, $1,500 in 1999, $2,000 in 2000 and $2,500 thereafter. The interest deduction can not be claimed for any interest amount paid prior to January 1, 1998. The Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning Credit will be available as a credit against federal income taxes beginning with 1998 tax returns. We advise you to consult your tax advisor to determine your eligibility for the deduction and tax credits.
